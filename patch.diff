-<!--
-  Before opening a new issue please:
-  
-  - Verify you have the latest versions of Jekyll and So Simple 
-    installed by running `bundle update`.
-  - Thoroughly read the theme's documentation at
-    https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/README.md
-  - Search all issues at https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/issues 
-    for solutions and to avoid duplication.
-  - Ask for help at https://talk.jekyllrb.com/

-## Description
-
-<!--
-  Describe the issue or proposed feature enhancement.
--->
-
-## Environment
-
-<!--
-  Please include theme version, Jekyll version, public git repository, whether 
-  you are hosting with GitHub Pages, and the operating system you tested with.
-
-  Issues without a link to a public repository or ZIP file will likely go ignored.
-  Being able to see your actual files is necessary to troubleshoot, as most 
-  issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured _config.sys 
-  file, or problematic site content.

-- So Simple version:
-- Ruby gem or remote theme version:
-- Jekyll version:
-- Git repository URL:

-- GitHub Pages hosted (if yes provide URL to site):

-  If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please test a local version
-  following these setup instructions: 
-  https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

+You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
+
+To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
+
+Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
+
+{% highlight ruby %}
+def print_hi(name)
+  puts "Hi, #{name}"
+end
+print_hi('Tom')
+#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
+{% endhighlight %}
+
+Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
